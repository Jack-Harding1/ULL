### Introduction
In this project, we experiment with and evaluate various word representation models.

### Running the code

We prepreocess the data to remove stopwords, punctuation and to restrict the vocabulary size. The parameters can be set in `preprocess.py`. The new dataset is created in the path `../data/processed/`.

Each of the files in src folder can be run independently `python <file_name>.py`. The code should run without errors if the data files are provided in the file structure mentioned [here](data).
